# Color System

Vanilla-JUI also provides a rich, accessible, automatically dark-mode-aware UI color system for building attractive and readable websites and applications.

## Features

1. Automatic dark mode: each color automatically switches variants based on the theme mode.
2. Transparent variants: each color has a transparent variant for translucent elements such as buttons and cards. This is also useful for mixed colors and gradients.
3. P3 color-gamut support: the default system supports the `P3 color gamut`, taking wide-gamut color mixing into account for better color display on high-end devices.
4. APCA text contrast: the modern `APCA` algorithm helps keep text readable on different background colors.
5. Accessibility: text colors and matching background colors keep enough reasonable contrast. The system follows the `WCAG 2.1 AA` standard to keep good readability in lower-contrast situations.
6. Color pairing: click a swatch below to view suggested pairings.

## File Paths

Because vanilla-jui only provides base styles by default and encourages users to fully customize styles, color-system tokens are not included in the default `tokens`.

Import `color.css` or `color_p3.css` as needed.

- `color.css`: color system, default.
- `color_p3.css`: P3 color-gamut color system. Advanced: only applies when both the browser software and screen hardware support the P3 color gamut.

## Palette and Color Tokens

This palette is not a simple ordered color scale. It is a product color guide calculated from a color algorithm carefully designed by the [WorkOS](https://workos.com/) team and validated in many mature products.

- Click a swatch to view suggested pairings and usage, and quickly copy color tokens.
- Click the theme button in the top-right corner to switch between light and dark modes and view color tokens in each mode.
